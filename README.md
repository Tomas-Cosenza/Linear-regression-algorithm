Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables
The goal is to find the best-fitting linear function that represents the relationship between the variables.
Linear regression is widely used in various fields such as economics, finance, social sciences, and machine learning due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in understanding and predicting relationships between variables.
